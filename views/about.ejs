                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Lilim Cafe and Food House began with a simple idea: to create a space where people can enjoy great food and coffee in a cozy, inviting environment. Our founders, Mr. Iko, had a deep love for culinary arts and a passion for bringing people together. In 2020, we opened our doors with the goal of serving delicious, home-cooked meals to our community.</p>
                <p>What started as a small cafe has grown into a beloved local spot where people gather for good food, good company, and a warm atmosphere. We continue to uphold our commitment to quality and hospitality with every dish we serve.</p>
